# Introduction to Perplexity Styled RAG App

This project demonstrates how to build a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) app in a style similar to Perplexity using Next.js, Superbase, and Lang Chain. The application leverages Superbase Realtime for database interactions instead of Firebase Realtime Database.

## Features

- **Free Setup**: The entire project can be set up for free using the free tier of Superbase, Brave Search API, and OpenAI for the Language Model (LLM).
- **Modular Language Models**: Different language models can be integrated by swapping out the backend chat portion.
- **OpenAI Integration**: While OpenAI API is used in the example, other LLMs can also be utilized.
- **API Keys**: API keys are required for OpenAI, Brave Search, and Superbase, which need to be obtained and configured.
- **Project Structure**: The project includes a frontend app, API, and plain JavaScript pages.

## Techstack

- **Next.js**: Frontend framework for building React applications.
- **Superbase**: Backend database with Realtime capabilities.
- **Lang Chain**: Backend for integrating and managing language models.
- **OpenAI**: API used for Language Model (LLM) tasks.
- **Brave Search**: API used for search functionalities.

## What I Learned

This project taught me how to integrate Realtime database capabilities using Superbase into a Next.js application. It also showed the process of setting up and integrating different APIs like OpenAI and Brave Search for LLM and search functionalities. Managing API keys securely and configuring environment variables for different environments was another key learning aspect.
